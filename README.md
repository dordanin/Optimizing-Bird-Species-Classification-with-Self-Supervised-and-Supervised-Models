1. Introduction
This project aims to compare the performance of self-supervised and supervised models across different optimizers for fine-grained image classification, with a particular focus on distinguishing between similar bird species. By leveraging transfer learning, we can utilize new pre-trained models and cutting-edge optimizers to achieve high accuracy in classifying these closely related species. This project and the dataset used are both publicly available.
Motivation
We undertook this project to explore which model, DINOv2 (a self-supervised model) or YOLOv8 (a supervised model), performs better in fine-grained image classification, while testing which optimizers gave the best result.
